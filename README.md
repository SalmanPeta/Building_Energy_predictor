# Building_Energy_predictor
A data science project focused on analyzing and forecasting building energy consumption using real-world environmental and operational data. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling using Python.
# Building Energy Consumption Analysis

#Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset on building energy consumption to gain insights into patterns and potential energy savings.
Using Python and data science techniques, we preprocess, visualize, and model energy consumption using various features 
such as temperature, humidity, and building characteristics.

#Files Included
- `Project_code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete code for analysis and modeling.
- `Building_energy_consumption_Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.txt`: Project documentation.

#Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Date/Time-based information
- Environmental conditions: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Energy metrics: Hourly energy consumption data for buildings

**Common columns:**
- `Datetime`
- `Building ID`
- `Energy Consumption (kWh)`
- `Temperature (Â°C)`
- `Humidity (%)`
- `Wind Speed (m/s)`

#Requirements

Install the following libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Or using a requirements file (if included):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `Project_code.ipynb`
2. Ensure the dataset `Building_energy_consumption_Dataset.csv` is in the same folder.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

#Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing or invalid entries.
- **Visualization**: Time series plots, correlation heatmaps, energy trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting useful features from date/time.
- **Modeling**: Applied regression techniques to predict energy usage.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as MAE, RMSE used to assess model performance.

#Goals

- Understand patterns of energy usage over time
- Identify peak consumption periods
- Explore correlation between external factors and energy demand
- Build predictive models for energy forecasting

#Future Enhancements

- Include weather forecast integration for real-time prediction
- Develop a dashboard for interactive analysis
- Try deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time series)
